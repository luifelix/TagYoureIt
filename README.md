# TagYoureIt
A photo tagging application.

In this project, a user will select a directory on their computer containing pictures. 
The application will have several functions:
  1. Adding tags to a picture(s)
  2. Finding pictures with the specific tag within a directory or a subdirectory
  3. Remove existing tags in a directory
  4. Keep track of tagging history for picture(s)

**Tags are shown in the picture names with "@". This can be used for organization sakes. You can store all the pictures of a vacation
to Hawaii as @Hawaii. Then whenever you want to see all the pictures from Hawaii, you can search for the tag.
This is a very simple application to use with a very simple interface.
